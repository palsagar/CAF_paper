\begin{abstract}
%% Text of abstract
   The computation of flows with large density contrasts is notoriously   difficult. To alleviate the difficulty we consider a consistent mass and   momentum-conserving discretization of the Navier-Stokes   equation. Incompressible flow with capillary forces is modelled   and the discretization is performed on a staggered grid of Marker   and Cell type. The Volume-of-Fluid method is used to track the   interface and a Height-Function method is used to compute surface   tension. The advection of the volume fraction is performed using   either the Lagrangian-Explicit / CIAM (Calcul d'Interface Affine par Morceaux)    method or the Weymouth and Yue (WY)   Eulerian-Implicit method. The WY method conserves fluid mass to machine    accuracy provided incompressiblity is satisfied which leads to    a method that is both momentum and mass-conserving.     To improve the stability of these methods   momentum fluxes are advected in a manner ``consistent'' with the   volume-fraction fluxes, that is a discontinuity of the momentum is   advected at the same speed as a discontinuity of the density. To   find the density on the staggered cells on which the velocity is   centered, an auxiliary reconstruction of the density is   performed. The method is tested for a droplet without surface   tension in uniform flow, for a droplet suddenly accelerated in a   carrying gas at rest at very large density ratio without viscosity   or surface tension, for the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, for a   falling raindrop and for an atomizing flow in air-water conditions.

\section{Conclusion}

We have presented and tested a simulation method for multiphase flow
that shows increased stability at large density contrasts and large
Reynolds numbers. The method is closely related to some variants of
the VOF method including an implementation of the WY advection method. 
The increased stability is evidenced in the test case
of a single $3$-mm droplet of water falling in air, a typical
raindrop. It is a reflection on the challenging nature of multiphase
flow that such complex methods apparently need to be implemented to
resolve such an everyday and simple phenomenon.

The method comes with a significant saving of computer time, since for 
similar problems with raindrops, our attempts with a non-momentum-conserving
VOF approach led to catastrophic deformation of the drop or strong dimple 
formation. These problems have also been observed by us using other 
non-VOF-consistent and non-momentum-conserving methods such as the one of 
\cite{popinet09}. In that case whenever less than 200 grid points per 
diameter are used numerically stable air-water 
drops accelerated at moderate Weber number cannot be found. However for
higher resolutions they can be computed without difficulty as also found 
by the authors of ref. \cite{Jain15}.
Here, approximate solutions accurate within 15\% are found with only 15 
points per diameter, and non-divergent computations are found with as little 
as 2 points per diameter. 

A particular advantage of the method is that it is conserving mass at the 
accuracy at which discrete incompressibility is enforced and opens a
perspective for similar momentum conservation using WY advection.
The method nevertheless is more complex and costly than a colocated method. 
This opens the perspective for systematic development of other methods with 
different grid arrangements. Another perspective is the potential
of stable methods with large density contrasts, exact mass and momentum conservation 
and small droplets, that could be smoothly merged into models that represent 
the small droplets as Lagrangian Point Particles \cite{Ling15}.
