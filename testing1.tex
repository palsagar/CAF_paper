\subsection{Consistent cylinder advection}

An elementary test of our method, that mostly verifies that the coding 
has been performed correctly, considers a uniform planar velocity field 
$u_1 = u_2 = 1.6 \times 10^{-2}$ and a droplet of density $\rho_l = 10^9$ 
in gas at density $\rho_g=1$ with a CFL number of $0.0256 \sqrt 2$.  
Viscosity and surface tension are set to zero in this test.  
The diameter of the droplet is $D/h=3.2$. The unit domain is discretized on a 
$16 \times 16$ grid. The droplet shapes that result are shown on the left 
of Figure \ref{CylAdv}. 
The irregularities seen in the advected droplet are due to the roughness of 
the VOF approximation at such low resolutions. We repeat the test with 
conditions close to air/water: viscosity $\mu_l = 0.1$, $\mu_g=0.002$ 
and  $\rho_g=1$, $\rho_l = 10^3$ with identical results: a viscosity contrast 
will not generate numerical instabilities on a uniform velocity field, as shown 
on the right of Figure~\ref{CylAdv}.

\subsection{Kelvin Helmholtz Instability}

The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability arises between unequal velocity fluid
streams. It is closely related to the issues addressed in the current
paper since it arises in many of the flows for which the current
method is designed, such as atomisation. Moreover, the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is particularly strong on a vortex sheet,
since (as we show below) it has for an infinitely thin sheet a
divergent growth rate as the wavenumber goes to infinity. Compounding
the issue, the baroclinic term of the vorticity equation leads to the
creation of a vortex sheet. In previous papers some of us have studied the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in viscous flows with surface tension
\cite{yecko02,boeck05,bague10}

We focus in this paper on the inviscid, no surface tension case since the
objective is to assess the manner in which the advection terms are
treated numerically. Moroever the inviscid, no surface tension case is
a kind of ``worst-case scenario'' without the stabilizing effects of viscosity
and capillarity.

The simplest setup is that of vortex sheeet, for which the growth rate is
given by
\be
\om_i = \frac{2 \sqrt r}{r+1}  k U  \label{omkazi}
\nd




\subsection{Sudden acceleration of a cylinder at large density contrast}

A test that is often included in studies of momentum-conserving methods
\cite{bussmann2002modeling,desjardins10,raessi12,le13,Vaudor:2017ip}
and other methods designed to improve the stability of two-phase flow
computations \cite{Fuster2013energy} is to initialize a droplet of very
high density at velocity $\U_l(\X)=U_0 \E_x$ with the other lighter fluid at
rest, so that $\U_g(\X)=0$. Surface tension and viscosity are not present 
as in the previous test, the only difference being the
discontinuity of the initial velocity on the interface. 
The initial velocity condition amounts to a vortex sheet on the surface 
of the cylinder. After the first time step, the projection method (\ref{fotm}) 
adds a dipole potential flow so that $\U_g = U_0 \E_x + \tau \nabla p / \rho_g$ 
in the gas around the droplet, identical to the dipole flow around a solid object.
However in addition to the dipole flow there could be small multipole components 
to the outer gas flow. 
There are three ways to estimate the perturbations created on the interface.

A vortex sheet is unstable with respect to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. 
The main results about the amplitude of the instability are as follows. 
Let $A(t)$ be the maximum deviation of the interface which has a dimension of length. 
For flows with no viscosity and surface tension
as is the case here, the  Kelvin-Helmholtz instability amplitude $A(t)$  should grow exponentially from a perturbation 
of wavenumber $k$ as $A(t) \sim A(0) \exp ( s_k t )$ with $s_k =| \Delta U | k/ \sqrt r  $ where $ \Delta U $ is
the tangential velocity difference and $r=\rho_l/\rho_g$. In the limit of large $r$ the growth rate becomes small. Since the maximum wavenumber on the grid is $\pi/h$ an estimate of the growth rate of the small wavelength instabilities is $\pi U_0 N/(D \sqrt r)$ where $N$ is the number of grid points per diameter. After advection by a droplet diameter, the 
elapsed time is $\Delta t = D/U_0$. For typical values in the literature of $r=10^6$ and an arbitrary value of 
$N=32$ the amplitude growth would be 
\be
\exp (s_{\rm max} \Delta t) =  \exp\left( \frac{\pi N}{ \sqrt r} \right) 
= \exp ( 0.032\pi) = 1.1058\ldots
\nd
which means the amplitude should grow by 10\% after advection by one diameter 
and by $e^{1/2}$ after the typical advection by 5 diameters. 

Beyond the linear growth stage of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, there is a 
self-similar, non-linear growth stage for which dimensional analysis implies
that $A(t) \sim | \Delta U | t/ \sqrt r $ \cite{hoepffner11}. By this argument 
also the perturbation of the cylinder should remain  of order  
$A(\Delta t) \sim D / \sqrt r$ after advection by a droplet diameter. 
One should note that the self-similar growth is obtained for vanishing boundary 
layer thickness but we precisely expect such a velocity discontinuity in 
the present case with no viscosity. 

A final, physical deformation is expected from the spatial pressure variation 
induced by the dipole gas flow. This variation involves a larger pressure at 
the aft and fore stagnation points and a lower pressure along the ``equator'' 
of the droplet \cite{Clift78}. The resulting integrated stress is of order 
$\rho_g U^2$ resulting in the growth of the droplet deformation as 
$A(t) \sim U^2 t^2 / (D r)$ and after advection by a droplet diameter as
$A(\Delta t) \sim D / r$. 
This growth is observed experimentally \cite{opfer14} and results in an 
elliptically shaped drop, albeit of much smaller amplitude than the two former 
Kelvin-Helmholtz-related growth mechanisms. 

The results are shown on Figure \ref{rich} for several times and
density ratios in a manner comparable to \cite{bussmann2002modeling}. For these
numerical experiments, the exact manner of initializing the velocity fields has 
some importance. It is important not to allow in the first time step some gas 
velocity in the liquid to avoid large pressure gradients in the liquid. 
Thus the density is initialized to $\rho_l$ to machine accuracy using the 
{\sc Vofi} library \cite{bna2015numerical,bna2016vofi}
within a disk implicitly defined by $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < R^2$ 
and the velocity is initialized to 1 for all the velocity nodes inside
a disk implicitly defined  by  $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 < (R+nh)^2$, where $n$ is the 
size of the ``halo'' in number of grid points. The velocity in the other
nodes is initialized to 0. The tests shown were performed with $n=1$. 
Increasing the size of the halo from $n=0$ to $n=1$ improves the results in the 
first phase of the droplet motion, but not in the late phase. 

The velocity of the motion has been oriented on the diagonal as in 
\cite{bussmann2002modeling}. The WY scheme is used with a QUICK
interpolant. The droplet deforms little after advection by one droplet 
diameter (Figure \ref{rich}). For longer advection the deformation is worse 
but, as explained above, this is to be expected
at high resolution, except in the $r=10^9$ case for which we show advection 
by 5 diameters in Figure \ref{long}. 
If the non-momentum-conserving method is used, the
droplet deforms rapidly and the simulation breaks down. As expected
the results are better than those of \cite{Fuster2013energy}, that uses the
skew-symmetric scheme but without momentum-conserving-like schemes, 
but worse than those of \cite{bussmann2002modeling,desjardins10,raessi12,le13}. 
It is also seen, as expected from the developments above, 
but perhaps contrary to intuition, that it is easier
to have larger density contrasts. Increasing the number of grid points also helps.


A comment can be made on the nature of the instabilities seen. If
 the gas velocity numerically diffuses inside the liquid, then some vorticity
may penetrate into the liquid despite the fact that in inviscid flow
vorticity should remain confined on the interface. If this happens,
the growth rate of a single-phase Kelvin-Helmholtz instability inside the 
liquid is the much larger value $\widetilde{s}_k =| \Delta U | k/2$, 
without the $\sqrt r$ factor at denominator. \red{(The derivation of this fact 
may be found for example in \cite{matas2011experimental}.)} 
The instability seen for the $r=10^9$ case for the long advection case in  Figure \ref{long} is 
a mode 3, which excludes the large linear growth discussed above for small 
wavelenghts rather points to the velocity diffusion mechanism. 
Minimizing numerical diffusion should then be an important
quality for this test, while on the other hand numerical diffusion may
stabilize other difficult test cases/situations.

\subsection{Sheared layer}
In order to better analyze the behavior of the methods in flow under shear, 
such as vortex sheets and Kelvin Helmholtz instabilities, we setup directly 
a planar, parallel shear flow in a $(-1/2,1/2)^2$ domain with the following 
initial condition
\bea
u_1& = 15 &\qquad {\rm if \;\;} |x_2| > 1/10 \nonumber \\
u_1& = 1  &\qquad {\rm if \;\;} |x_2| < 1/10 \nonumber 
\nda
$$
u_2  =  0.01\, \sin(2 \pi x_1) \exp(-20 x_2^2)
$$
and $\rho=1$  if $|x_2| > 1/10$ and $\rho=10^3$ otherwise. 
This flow is similar to a liquid sheet in high velocity gas. The flow is 
simulated until time $t_f=2$ unless the simulation blows up at an earlier time
$t_b <t_f$.
Table \ref{shearmtable} shows the numerical schemes that have been used in a few
simulations together with the fraction $t_{b}/t_f$ of the final time that has 
been reached. All simulations have been performed on a $128\times128$ grid with 
a CFL of 0.03 and a density ratio of 1000. The new method (MC) is
systematically more stable than the standard method for the two combinations 
shown in Table \ref{shearmtable}: a) the WY VOF scheme and the QUICK-UW velocity 
interpolation schemes and b) the CIAM VOF with the Superbee slope limiters. 
The state of the two simulations with the first combination of schemes is shown
in Figure~\ref{shelay}, just before breakdown at time $t_b = 0.34$ 
(or $t_b/t_f = 0.17$) for the (MC) method, and at time  $t_b = 0.16$ 
(or $t_b/t_f = 0.08$) for the standard method. We have also tested a number of other
combinations, for example  WY \& Superbee that turns out to be very unstable.  
We have also performed simulations with smaller  $64\times64$ and $32\times32$ 
grids that yield similar results. 
Finally, we note that this case is also unstable in a single-phase configuration 
when using the QUICK third-order velocity interpolation.

\subsection{Falling Raindrop}
\input{raindrop.tex}

\subsection{Atomizing air and water planar jets}

We also test the capability of the VOF-consistent momentum-conserving scheme 
to simulate complex air-water flows with an unstable shear flow. For that 
purpose we repeat the setup of reference \cite{Ling16}. Two jets of air and water 
are entering the computational domain from the left of Figure \ref{atom}
at velocities comparable to those of experiments. However in order to 
save computational time the domain is smaller than in experiments. Physical 
properties of air and water are identical to those of the falling raindrop case 
given in Table \ref{raindropprop}. The flow and domain characteristics are 
given in Table \ref{PhysicalParam} including a gas boundary layer 
and separator-plate size identical to those of reference \cite{Ling16}. 
The notations are as in reference \cite{Ling16}: $H_p$ is the thickness of the
jet of phase $p$, there is a separator plate of thickness $l_y$ and a 
gas boundary layer of thickness $\delta_g$.  The two streams have 
equal thickness $H_l=H_g$. The dimensionless parameters are given in 
Table \ref{dimensionlessParam}. The CIAM advection method has been used. 
The number of grid points in the layer $H_l/h = 16$ is relatively small
(compared to the  $H_l/h = 32$ in the smallest (coarsest) simulation
of reference \cite{Ling16}). It is thus all the more remarkable that the 
simulation is stable since using a smaller number of grid points usually 
increases the trend towards instability. It is interesting to note 
that the VOF calculations accounts for 31.5\% of the total time, while the 
inversion of the Poisson operator for the pressure accounted for 51.5\%. 
The whole simulations runs overnight on a present-day workstation.
